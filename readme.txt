Harmonia turns any link to an MP3 or M4A file into a minimalist inline audio player.

Inspired by the late-lamented [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/) Playtagger, Harmonia turns any link to an MP3 or M4A file into a minimalist inline audio player using [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org).

* Tested in Chrome, Firefox, IE 8+, Safari and Mobile Safari (iPhone and iPad)
* Uses HTML5 audio where available with Flash fallback
* Zero configuration

The code herein was initially developed for the fine folks at [Said the Gramophone](http://saidthegramophone.com/).
